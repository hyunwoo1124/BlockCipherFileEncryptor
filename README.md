Programming Language

    C++


Execution Prompt

    ./cipher AES "00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff" ENC in.txt out.txt

    ./cipher AES "10112233445566778899aabbccddeeff" DEC out.txt plaintext.txt

    ./cipher DES "0123456789abcdef" ENC in.txt out.txt

    ./cipher DES "0123456789abcdef" DEC out.txt  desDecPlaintext.txt


Extra Credit

    DES and AES took longer than we anticipated, decided to focus our time into

    studying the midterm for Cryptography and Websecurity!


Special Note

    This project was indeed difficult but we gained insight of how AES and DES

    works in the coding. We were able to visualize the differences and learn alot.
